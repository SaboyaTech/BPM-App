The Technology: 

Firebase - Real time data 
Animate.css - Animation library
AngularJS - Structural framework for dynamic web apps

OR (Just some ideas) Angular is tough to learn is more advance It’s the competition of React.Js which is what we are going to learn much later in class

Here I was just thinking perhaps we could show all the technologies we used
HTML5
CSS3
BootStrap 4.2
Javascript
J.Query - JavaScript Library allows DOM manipulation
AJAX
YouTube API
Twitter API
Spotify API
Firebase - Realtime database

Here I thought we could demonstrate the new technology. SASS is a much easier and allows you to use variables inside of CSS. https://sass-lang.com/
New Technology: 

SASS - CSS Extension

npm install -g node-sass
npm install -g gulp-sass

//windows
npm install -g gulp
//mac
sudo -s npm install -g gulp
